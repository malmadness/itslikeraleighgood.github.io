<h1>It's Like Raleigh Good</h1>
<h2>Hello Internet! Is the lack of styling on this page killing you? Me too.</h2>
<h3>Let me explain..</h3>
<p>For the last few months (or more accurately, sporadically throughout the last year), I have been attempting to improve my html and css skills while also learning JavaScript. The hardest part about this has been investing time in a project that I don’t give a shit about. Sure it’s exciting when you figure out how to make a little cartoon man jump onto a platform that you added to a game, but also who the fuck cares?</p>

<p>I was a food blogger in a previous life and I ended up quitting for a lot of reasons. For one, I got way too obsessed with tracking website traffic and attracting followers. I stared blogging because I enjoyed being creative in the kitchen and sharing my learnings along they way, not because I cared how many people viewed a blog post. Creating new content became a chore and I stopped enjoying the process.</p>

<p>Another huge reason I quit blogging was because I knew close to nothing about web development. I never felt like I could get my blog to look or feel the way I wanted it to and I had no idea to fix it. At the time, I was still pretty new to my career as a Quality Engineer, working for a government contractor testing several websites that collected data behind the scenes of HealthCare.gov. Well fast forward seven years, I feel like I am definitely more than capable of building a website with some practice!</p>

<p>SO all of that is to say my blog is a work in progress. I’m posting this first entry because I plan to share the evolution of my blog as it progresses while I learn over the next few months. What am I going to blog about? Guess you’ll have to come back to see!</p>
